# ft_retro

ft_retro is a gradius-like game; it uses the ncurses library.

If you launch the game using ./ft_retro help, you'll have access to different playmodes for extra difficulty and a no shooting challenge.
You gain points every time you shoot something, but you lose points if something get out of the screen.

Have fun !
